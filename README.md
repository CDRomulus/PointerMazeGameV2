# PointerMazeGameV2

A console maze game using dynamically created objects. A revisit to my first Univiersity C++ assignment.

Each room (Node) of the maze contains an array of references to connected nodes.

Uses raw pointers.  

Visual C++ and GNU/C++ compiler compatible. 
Windows and Linux compatible.
